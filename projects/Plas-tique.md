## About

Tell us about your project!

Here are some questions to help you get going...

- What/who is it for? 

Web App to track personal contribution to reduce plastic pollution on the everyday basis. System analyses plastic packaging 
to detect the type of plastic, quality & quantity of plastic, degradation time, recyclability, etc. Few examples of the 
plastics are sandwich containers, chocolate wrappers, water bottles which is usually found in the super market. 
A dashboard shows the daily stats with a progress bar to reach a desired target or compare with the previous usage. 
It will also provide recommendation to the alternatives such as link to related reusable products or direction to 
nearby zero waste shops. Gamification can also bring enthusiasm to reduce pollution within family, work colleagues or friends.

- What problem is it trying to solve?

Plastic pollution is one of the most important environmental problems that we face today. It impacts
the environment and our health and wellbeing. We have all contributed to this problem – mostly
unknowingly – and we must work to reduce and ultimately to End Plastic Pollution. 


- What was the motivation befind?

Protect mother earth, sea creatures, animals and even humans from hazardous substances in plastics. 


- What inspired you?

 Articles, news and scientific studies about plastic pollutions gave us isight to the scale of the issue. 
 We will not be able to stop plastic production however encouraging people to reduce consumption is definetly possible. 


- How did you come up with the idea?

With the help of technology we want to bring awareness to the people at personal level to help 
them reduce the plastic footprint on their daily lives.
